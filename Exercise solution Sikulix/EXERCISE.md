## Exercise

### A. Building the script

<ul>
  <li>In your browser, open the example page at jtrpinto.github.io/badboy/bbc_complete.html;</li>
  <li>This page simulates a situation of registration in a club;</li>
  <li>The page presents alerts in several situations: (a) The user did not accept the rules; (b) The user did not fill all the required fields; (c) The specified name was a number; (d) The specified age was not a number; (e) The specified country was a number; (f) Everything is correct;</li>
  <li>Using SikuliX, you should build a script with 7 tests: The first to ensure every element in the page is presented, and each of the other 6 to ensure the alerts are presented for each of the situations described above in (a)-(f);</li>
  <li>After building the script, refresh the page and run it to make sure it works (it shouldn't present any error, make sure to use if conditionals to avoid the script from stopping before the end).</li>
</ul>

### B. Checking on a flawed site

<ul>
  <li>In chrome, open a new page at jtrpinto.github.io/badboy/bbc.html;</li>
  <li>Run the script with this page open;</li>
  <li>Verify the results of the tests (3 of them should fail).</li>
</ul>
